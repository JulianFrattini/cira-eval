## Summary of the Artifact

This repository contains the code to evaluate the capability of the [CiRA tool](https://github.com/JulianFrattini/cira) to automatically generate test case descriptions from causal natural language requirements. To this end, the requirements of the [Corona Warn App](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/main/scoping_document.md) were manually classified as either *causal* or *non-causal*, and for all causal sentences a set of test cases were generated. The analysis in this repository compares the manually generated test cases with the output of CiRA.

## Structure of the Artifact

This repository contains the following files:

* `data`: data necessary for the evaluation
  * `cwa-acceptance-criteria`: list of sentences constituting the acceptance criteria of the Corona Warn App, manually classified as either *causal* or *non-causal*
  * `ground-truth`: a json files containing a manually generated set of test cases following the CiRA test suite syntax for every *causal* sentence
* `src\evaluation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for performing the calculation
* `requirements.txt`: required Python libraries for executing the evaluation

## How to reproduce

In order to reproduce the evaluation, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure both [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) are available on your system.
2. Install the [requirements](./requirements.txt) by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Make sure the [CiRA tool](https://github.com/JulianFrattini/cira) is available on your system.
    1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/JulianFrattini/cira/blob/main/README.md) to set up the CiRA tool on your system.
    2. Ensure that the REST API, which the CiRA tool provides, is currently running by pinging `http://localhost:8000/api/health`, which should return a json object containing at least a version string in response.
4. Execute the [evaluation](./src/evaluation.ipynb) notebook.
